# End-to-end docker workflow scenarios

These `overlay-*.toml` files are **not** standalone configurations. Each one
contains only a scenario's `[global.access_policy]` and `[repository.*]`
sections (the registry-facing behaviour under test).

The `Build` workflow ([.github/workflows/build.yaml](../../.github/workflows/build.yaml))
runs every scenario against the same backend matrix as the conformance suite
(`fs-inherit`, `fs-split`, `s3-variable-parts`, `s3-uniform-parts`). For each
matrix variant it:

1. Strips the trailing `[global.access_policy]` + `[repository."conformance"]`
   block from the variant's `conformance/config-*.toml` to obtain a
   backend-only fragment.
2. Concatenates that fragment with each scenario overlay to produce a complete
   config, so the e2e workflows exercise the exact backend under test.

| Overlay                     | Scenario                                                    |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `overlay-push.toml`         | push an image to angos, drop it locally, pull it back       |
| `overlay-cache.toml`        | pull-through cache for Docker Hub                           |
| `overlay-replication-a.toml`| replication source; mirrors the `repl` repo to instance B   |
| `overlay-replication-b.toml`| replication target (runs on port 8001)                      |

For the replication scenario the two instances share the same backend service
(rustfs), so instance B is rewritten to use an isolated S3 bucket
(`registry-b`). Filesystem backends are already isolated because each instance
runs in its own container.

## Split blob/metadata backends

The push scenario also runs a second time against a **split backend**: the
workflow rewrites the blob and metadata stores onto distinct key spaces (for S3,
fresh `registry-split-blob` / `registry-split-meta` buckets; for filesystem, a
distinct metadata on-disk root). This pins that manifest content is stored as a
blob in the blob store (where reads look), not inside the metadata
transaction; otherwise the manifest GET and pull-back 404. The S3 blob bucket is
deliberately one no earlier step has written to, so the content-addressed
manifest blob can't already be present and mask the bug.

It runs only on variants that configure an explicit metadata store, which the
workflow then diverges (`fs-split` and both s3 variants); `fs-inherit` inherits
the blob store as a single store and is skipped. The symmetric delete/GC
reclaim path is covered by the `manifest_blob_lives_in_blob_store_with_split_backends`
unit test rather than here.
