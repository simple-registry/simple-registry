## HTTP Metrics

### http_requests_total

Total number of HTTP requests.

| Type    | Labels                      |
|---------|-----------------------------|
| Counter | `method`, `route`, `status` |

**Labels:**
- `method`: HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.)
- `route`: Route action (e.g., `get-manifest`, `get-blob`, `list-tags`)
- `status`: HTTP status code (`200`, `404`, `500`, etc.)

**Example:**
```promql
# Request rate over 5 minutes
rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# Error rate (5xx responses)
rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])

# Requests by route
sum by (route) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))

# GET requests for manifests
rate(http_requests_total{method="GET", route="get-manifest"}[5m])
```

### http_request_duration_ms

HTTP request latency in milliseconds.

| Type      | Labels            |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Histogram | `method`, `route` |

**Example:**
```promql
# 95th percentile latency
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_ms_bucket[5m]))

# Average latency
rate(http_request_duration_ms_sum[5m]) / rate(http_request_duration_ms_count[5m])

# Latency by route
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (route, le) (rate(http_request_duration_ms_bucket[5m])))

# Manifest pull latency
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_ms_bucket{route="get-manifest"}[5m]))
```

### http_requests_in_flight

Current number of HTTP requests being processed.

| Type  | Labels |
|-------|--------|
| Gauge | none   |

**Example:**
```promql
# Current in-flight requests
http_requests_in_flight

# Max in-flight over time
max_over_time(http_requests_in_flight[1h])
```

## Lock Metrics

Distributed-lock operations: acquisition, heartbeat invalidation, and stale-lock recovery. The `backend` label names the configured lock backend; see [Distributed Locking](configuration.md#distributed-locking) for its configuration.

| Metric | Type | Labels | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| `lock_acquisition_duration_ms` | Histogram | `backend` | Lock acquisition duration in milliseconds |
| `lock_acquisitions_total` | Counter | `backend`, `result` | Total lock acquisition attempts |
| `lock_retries_total` | Counter | `backend` | Total lock acquisition retries |
| `lock_invalidations_total` | Counter | `backend`, `reason` | Total lock invalidations |
| `lock_recoveries_total` | Counter | `backend`, `result` | Total stale lock recovery attempts |

**Label Values:**

- `backend`: `s3`, `redis`, `memory`
- `result` (acquisitions): `success`, `timeout`, `error`
- `result` (recoveries): `success` (stale lock claimed), `lost_race` (another instance claimed it first)
- `reason` (invalidations): `ownership_lost`, `max_hold_exceeded`, `heartbeat_failure`, `file_disappeared` (both S3 and Redis report transient-failure-driven cancellations as `heartbeat_failure`)

**Example:**
```promql
# Lock acquisition failures by backend
sum by (backend, result) (rate(lock_acquisitions_total{result!="success"}[5m]))

# P95 lock acquisition latency
histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(lock_acquisition_duration_ms_bucket[5m]))
```

## Job Queue Metrics

`angos_job_queue_pending` and `angos_job_queue_failed` are published only when
`[global.job_queue]` is configured; the two counters below increment on every
enqueue (the in-process queue included) and are always exposed on the server's
`/metrics`. See [Enable Durable Cache Jobs](../how-to/durable-cache-jobs.md).

### angos_job_queue_pending

Pending jobs that are **ready for handling within the readiness horizon**
(`not_before ≤ now + pending_ready_horizon_secs`, default 600 seconds).
Suitable for KEDA-style autoscaling of `angos worker` pods. Refreshed by a
background ticker on every server replica.

Envelopes backed off further into the future are deliberately excluded so the
gauge tracks *actionable* work: spinning up workers for jobs that won't be
claimable for an hour wastes capacity. Tune `pending_ready_horizon_secs`
(under `[global.job_queue]`) to give your autoscaler enough lead time to spin
up replicas before the work becomes ready.

The gauge **saturates at 10 000**: any value at the cap should be read as
"≥ 10 000". Combined with the readiness-horizon filter, this bounds the S3
`LIST` cost per refresh tick to ~10 paginated calls regardless of queue depth.
KEDA's `ScaledObject` only needs ordinal granularity above its scale-to-max
threshold, which is normally well below this cap.

| Type  | Labels  |
|-------|---------|
| Gauge | `queue` |

### angos_job_queue_failed

Dead-lettered jobs currently held in the queue (jobs that exhausted their retry
budget). Refreshed by the same server-side background ticker as
`angos_job_queue_pending`, so it stays scrapeable even when `angos worker`
drains the queue. Saturates at 10 000 like the pending gauge. Alert on
`angos_job_queue_failed{queue="replication"} > 0` to catch stuck replication.

| Type  | Labels  |
|-------|---------|
| Gauge | `queue` |

### angos_job_queue_enqueued_total

Total jobs submitted to the queue.

| Type    | Labels             |
|---------|--------------------|
| Counter | `queue`, `dedup`   |

**Labels:**
- `queue`: queue name (e.g. `cache`, `replication`)
- `dedup`: `hit` when a duplicate `lock_key` was suppressed, otherwise `miss`

---

### angos_job_queue_enqueue_failures_total

Total enqueue attempts that did not land on the queue (envelope build or storage error).

| Type    | Labels  |
|---------|---------|
| Counter | `queue` |

**Labels:**
- `queue`: queue name (e.g. `cache`, `replication`)

---

## Replication Metrics

The `angos_job_queue_pending{queue="replication"}` gauge (above) reports
replication backlog depth; the metrics below cover push outcomes, staleness,
and `angos replicate` reconciliation. See
[Bi-Directional Replication](../explanation/replication.md).

`angos_replication_push_total` and
`angos_replication_last_success_timestamp_seconds` increment in the process
that drains the replication queue. Without `[global.job_queue]` the server
drains the queue in-process, so both appear on the server's `/metrics`. With
`[global.job_queue]` the queue is drained by `angos worker`, which exposes no
HTTP endpoint, so in that mode these two metrics are not scrapeable; use the
server-published `angos_job_queue_failed{queue="replication"}` gauge to alert on
stuck replication and `angos_job_queue_pending{queue="replication"}` for
backlog.

### angos_replication_push_total

Total replication pushes to a downstream, by outcome.

| Type    | Labels                  |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Counter | `downstream`, `outcome` |

**Labels:**
- `downstream`: the configured downstream `name`
- `outcome`: `pushed` (manifest/blobs transferred, or a delete applied), `converged` (the downstream already matched, a push whose digest was already present, or a delete whose target was already absent so nothing transferred), `superseded` (downstream already held a newer copy, last-writer-wins, counted as success), `unsupported` (the downstream rejected the delete method with `405`, e.g. it does not support tag deletion; the job completes without converging rather than dead-lettering), or `failed` (the push errored and the job will retry)

**Example:**
```promql
# Push rate by downstream and outcome
sum by (downstream, outcome) (rate(angos_replication_push_total[5m]))

# Replication failure rate
sum by (downstream) (rate(angos_replication_push_total{outcome="failed"}[5m]))
```

### angos_replication_last_success_timestamp_seconds

Unix timestamp (seconds) of the last `pushed`, `converged`, or `superseded` replication push per downstream (the convergent outcomes set it; `unsupported` and `failed` do not). Use it to detect a stalled downstream.

| Type  | Labels       |
|-------|--------------|
| Gauge | `downstream` |

**Example:**
```promql
# Seconds since the last successful push (staleness) per downstream
time() - angos_replication_last_success_timestamp_seconds
```

### angos_replication_reconcile_total

Replication reconcile enqueues emitted by `angos replicate`, by outcome.

| Type    | Labels    |
|---------|-----------|
| Counter | `outcome` |

**Labels:**
- `outcome`: `enqueued` (a divergence was enqueued: a push, or a prune delete for a `prune = true` downstream), `failed` (the envelope build or enqueue errored), or `skipped` (a downstream HEAD probe failed, e.g. auth rejection, 5xx, or timeout, so the tag stays unreconciled this pass; a persistently non-zero `skipped` with zero `enqueued` typically means bad downstream credentials)

This counter lives in the `angos replicate` process, which serves no `/metrics`
endpoint and exits when the run completes, so Prometheus cannot scrape it. The
warn-level log lines emitted for failed and skipped tags are the operational
signal: watch the replicate run's logs (or its exit status) rather than this
counter.

### Replication Backlog

Replication shares the durable job queue, so backlog depth is reported by
`angos_job_queue_pending{queue="replication"}` (see [Job Queue Metrics](#job-queue-metrics)).

```promql
# Pending replication pushes
angos_job_queue_pending{queue="replication"}
```

A deep replication queue is the normal state during a downstream outage and does
**not** affect `/readyz`. Alert on sustained backlog instead. When the server
drains the queue in-process (no `[global.job_queue]`), the staleness gauge is
also on the server's `/metrics` and supports a staleness alert:

```promql
# Replication stale for over 10 minutes (in-process drain only)
(time() - angos_replication_last_success_timestamp_seconds) > 600
```

With a separate `angos worker`, the gauge is not scrapeable; alert on the
server-published `angos_job_queue_failed{queue="replication"}` dead-letter gauge
(stuck pushes) and the `angos_job_queue_pending{queue="replication"}` backlog
instead.

```promql
# Stuck replication pushes (dead-lettered)
angos_job_queue_failed{queue="replication"} > 0
```
