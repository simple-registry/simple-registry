# Configure Replication

Mirror a repository's content to one or more downstream registries as it changes. Two Angos instances configured as each other's downstreams form an active-active pair. See [Bi-Directional Replication](../explanation/replication.md) for the concepts.

## Prerequisites

- Two or more reachable Angos instances (or any OCI-compliant downstream registry).
- A credential on each downstream that is allowed to push and delete (`put-manifest`, `delete-manifest`, blob uploads). Replication mirrors deletes and `prune` enqueues deletes, so a push-only credential without `delete-manifest` has every replicated delete rejected and dead-lettered. See [Set Up Access Control](set-up-access-control.md).

## Declare a Downstream

Replication is configured per repository, alongside `upstream`. Add one `[[repository."<name>".downstream]]` table per downstream:

```toml
[repository."nginx"]

[[repository."nginx".downstream]]
name = "eu-region"                    # local identifier (appears in logs and metrics)
url = "https://angos-eu.example.com"
username = "replicator"
password = "..."
mode = "event+reconcile"              # "event+reconcile" | "event-only" | "reconcile-only"
namespace_filter = ["^nginx/.*"]      # optional regex list; empty matches all namespaces
max_concurrent_pushes = 4             # optional; per-manifest blob fan-out (positive integer, default 4)
```

### Downstream Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | required | Local identifier for this downstream (used in logs and the `downstream` metric label) |
| `url` | string | required | Downstream registry URL. A bare host mirrors the namespace verbatim; a path (`http://host:8000/team`) becomes the namespace prefix the content lands under, replacing the source repository prefix (`<repo>/x` → `team/x`). Angos serves the OCI API at `/v2/` root, so the path is mapped into the namespace, not the HTTP path. See [Fan out into sibling repositories](#fan-out-into-sibling-repositories). |
| `mode` | string | `"event+reconcile"` | `"event+reconcile"`, `"event-only"`, or `"reconcile-only"` |
| `namespace_filter` | [string] | `[]` (all) | Regex patterns; a namespace replicates to this downstream only if it matches one |
| `max_concurrent_pushes` | usize | `4` | Concurrent blob pushes per manifest for this downstream (positive integer, >= 1) |
| `prune` | bool | `false` | When `true`, reconciliation also **deletes** tags present on this downstream but absent locally (authoritative one-way mirror). **Leave `false` for active-active peers**; see [Reconcile on Demand](#reconcile-on-demand). |
| `username` / `password` | string | - | Basic auth for the downstream |
| `max_redirect` | u8 | `5` | Maximum redirects to follow |
| `connect_timeout_secs` | u64 | `30` | Timeout for establishing the connection (TCP + TLS handshake) |
| `read_timeout_secs` | u64 | `300` | Timeout for inactivity between reads during a transfer; a slow but progressing blob transfer is never cut off by a total deadline |
| `server_ca_bundle` | string | - | CA bundle to verify the downstream's TLS certificate |
| `client_certificate` / `client_private_key` | string | - | mTLS to the downstream (both required together) |

### Modes

| Mode | Live pushes on mutation | Included in `angos replicate` |
|------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `event+reconcile` | Yes | Yes |
| `event-only` | Yes | No |
| `reconcile-only` | No | Yes |

:::note Removing or renaming a downstream
Pending jobs for a removed or renamed downstream fail loudly and dead-letter after their retry budget. They are cleared by `angos prune` (use `--dry-run` to preview), or inspect them via the jobs admin UI or the [`_jobs` API](../reference/api-endpoints.md#list-failed-jobs) (`?queue=replication`).
:::

:::note Reclaiming stranded blobs on a receiver
When a replicated manifest push uploads a blob but its manifest then loses last-writer-wins or dead-letters, the receiver keeps the blob's per-namespace ownership grant with no manifest referencing it, pinning the bytes. `angos prune` treats such grants as retention subjects (untagged, `pushed_at` = upload time): once the blob is past the `-u` in-flight window, a grant no retention rule keeps is revoked and the bytes reclaimed. Configure a time-based rule (e.g. `image.pushed_at > now() - days(7)`) to bound how long stranded grants linger.
:::

## Fan out into sibling repositories

A bare-host `url` mirrors the namespace verbatim, which suits a separate registry. To mirror a repository into a different repository on the **same** instance (or under a different prefix on another instance), put that prefix on the `url` path: it replaces the source repository prefix, so `team/app` lands as `team-a/app`. Angos serves the OCI API at the root, so the path is mapped into the namespace rather than the HTTP path.

```toml
[[repository."team".downstream]]
name = "team-a"
url = "https://angos.example.com/team-a"   # path -> namespace prefix

[[repository."team".downstream]]
name = "team-b"
url = "https://angos.example.com/team-b"

[repository."team-a"]          # the receiving repositories
[repository."team-b"]
```

A push to `team/<image>` then fans out to `team-a/<image>` and `team-b/<image>`. With a bare-host `url`, replicating to the same instance would re-target the source repository itself (a self-loop, suppressed as a no-op) rather than landing in a sibling.

## Global Knobs

One `[global]` field tunes replication across all repositories:

```toml
[global]
max_concurrent_replication_jobs = 4                # worker concurrency for replication jobs (must be > 0)
```

- `max_concurrent_replication_jobs` bounds how many replication jobs are handled in parallel by each `angos worker`, the server's in-process drain, and the `angos replicate` end-of-run drain. Default `4`; must be greater than zero.

:::warning Restrict who may push to replicated repositories
A replication write is an ordinary manifest push carrying the `X-Angos-Source-Timestamp` header, and the receiver persists that timestamp as the tag's creation time. It's the value that decides last-writer-wins races and age-based retention. Future-dating is clamped, but **any identity allowed to push can backdate a tag**. On every instance that receives replication, gate the write actions (`put-manifest`, `delete-manifest`, uploads) to the replicator identity through the CEL `access_policy`, see [Restrict replication writes](set-up-access-control.md#restrict-replication-writes).

## Worker vs In-Process Drain

How replication work is drained depends on `[global.job_queue]`:

### In-Process (server self-drains)

With **no** `[global.job_queue]` section, the server drains the replication queue itself, in-process. This is the simplest setup (run only `angos server` on each instance) and is ideal for a single-instance or demo deployment. Jobs still persist to the configured fs/S3 store (under `_jobs/`) and resume after a restart; what you give up versus a separate worker is cross-replica coordination and the queue-depth gauge, not durability.

### Separate Worker

With `[global.job_queue]` configured, the server only enqueues jobs; you must run a worker to drain them. A bare `angos worker` drains **both** the replication and cache queues (each on its own pool); pass `--queue replication` to drain replication alone, for example to scale it independently:

```bash
angos -c config.toml worker                      # drains both cache and replication
angos -c config.toml worker --queue replication  # replication only
```

This is the multi-replica, horizontally-scalable configuration: draining is decoupled from serving and can be scaled independently. (Pending pushes persist under `_jobs/pending/replication/` and resume after a restart in both modes.) See [Enable Durable Cache Jobs](durable-cache-jobs.md) for the job-queue setup, KEDA autoscaling, and `angos worker` details.

Because the queue is drained by separate processes, workers serialize on leased claim keys created atomically on the metadata store's backend (`link(2)` on FS, `If-None-Match: *` on S3); a startup probe verifies the backend enforces the atomic create before `[global.job_queue]` is served. Nothing extra needs configuring.

## Two-Instance Active-Active Example

Configure each instance with the other as a downstream for the same repository. With no `[global.job_queue]`, each server self-drains in-process; no separate worker is needed.

**Instance A** (`config-a.toml`):

```toml
[server]
bind_address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8000

[global]
max_concurrent_replication_jobs = 4

[blob_store.fs]
root_dir = "/data"

[repository."nginx"]

[repository."nginx".access_policy]
default = "allow"

[[repository."nginx".downstream]]
name = "instance-b"
url = "http://angos-b:8000"
mode = "event+reconcile"
```

**Instance B** (`config-b.toml`) is the mirror image, pointing its downstream at instance A.

Push to A and the tag appears on B within a few seconds:

```bash
docker push localhost:8000/nginx/app:v1
# ... shortly after ...
docker pull localhost:8001/nginx/app:v1   # served from B
```

## Reconcile on Demand

When the event path misses a change (an instance was down, or two instances drifted after a partition), reconcile explicitly:

```bash
# Preview the pushes that would be enqueued; enqueues nothing
angos -c config.toml replicate --dry-run

# Enqueue the diverging tags and drain them end-of-run
angos -c config.toml replicate
```

By default reconciliation is **additive**: it pushes diverging or downstream-missing tags and never deletes. With `--dry-run` it previews the work without enqueuing anything: it lists an `EnqueueReplicationPush` for each diverging or downstream-missing tag and, for any downstream marked `prune = true`, an `EnqueueReplicationDelete` for each downstream-only tag.

A downstream marked `prune = true` is treated as an **authoritative one-way mirror**: reconciliation also enumerates its tags (via the OCI `list-tags` endpoint) and deletes any that are absent locally, so it converges exactly to the local tag set. Retention enforcement (`angos prune`) mirrors its deletions to `prune = true` downstreams as well, and only to those, so additive downstreams never lose content because of upstream retention. Pruning is **one-way-mirror-only**: enabling it on an active-active peer would delete a tag the peer authored that has not yet replicated back.

**Leave `prune = false` for active-active peers.** The delete does carry a `source_ts`, so the receiver applies last-writer-wins rather than deleting unconditionally. But that only protects a downstream tag dated in the future relative to the reconcile decision. A peer's legitimately-newer tag whose `created_at` predates the reconcile run is still removed.

Re-running is a no-op once converged (coalesced by the queue). Schedule it like any other maintenance task, via a systemd timer (a oneshot service running `angos -c config.toml replicate`, triggered by `OnCalendar=*-*-* 04:00:00`) or a Kubernetes CronJob (`schedule: "0 4 * * *"`); see [Run Storage Maintenance](run-storage-maintenance.md#scheduling) for complete examples.

## Observability

Replication exposes Prometheus metrics:

```promql
# Push rate by downstream and outcome (pushed, converged, superseded, unsupported, failed)
sum by (downstream, outcome) (rate(angos_replication_push_total[5m]))

# Seconds since the last successful push per downstream (staleness)
time() - angos_replication_last_success_timestamp_seconds

# Pending replication backlog
angos_job_queue_pending{queue="replication"}
```

The push and staleness metrics are scrapeable on the server's `/metrics` only when it drains the queue in-process (no `[global.job_queue]`); with a separate `angos worker` they are not scrapeable, so monitor `angos_job_queue_pending{queue="replication"}` instead. See [Replication Metrics](../reference/metrics.md#replication-metrics) for the scrapeability details and the full list.

## Troubleshooting

**Pushes never reach the downstream:**
- Confirm the downstream `url` is reachable from the source instance.
- Verify the credential is authorized to push on the downstream (`put-manifest`, `delete-manifest`, blob uploads).
- If `[global.job_queue]` is configured, ensure an `angos worker` is running (it drains the replication queue by default); the server only enqueues.

**Replicated deletes fail and dead-letter (`403`):**
- The downstream credential is missing `delete-manifest`. Replication issues deletes as ordinary `DELETE` manifest calls, so a push-only credential has every replicated or pruned delete rejected with `403` and the job dead-letters after its retry budget. Grant `delete-manifest` to the replicator identity (see [Set Up Access Control](set-up-access-control.md)) and retry the dead-lettered jobs via the [`_jobs` API](../reference/api-endpoints.md#list-failed-jobs) (`?queue=replication`).

**A tag does not overwrite on the downstream:**
- The downstream copy may be newer (last-writer-wins): a `409 REPLICATION_SUPERSEDED` is convergence, not failure.
- The downstream tag may be immutable: a `409 DENIED` surfaces and the job retries; relax immutability or pick a different tag.

**Reconciliation reports nothing to do but instances differ:**
- Confirm the downstream's `mode` includes reconciliation (`event+reconcile` or `reconcile-only`).
- Confirm the namespace matches the downstream's `namespace_filter`.

**Debug logging:**
```bash
RUST_LOG=angos::replication=debug ./angos server
```
