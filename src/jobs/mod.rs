//! Job-queue vocabulary shared across altitudes: the durable job store, the
//! CLI commands, the admin API actions, and the request router all speak these
//! serialized value types without depending on the queue machinery itself.
//!
//! The machinery itself lives beneath: [`store`] persists and claims durable
//! jobs over the shared object store, and [`runner`] drives one claimed job
//! through its handler. Domain handlers (cache fill, replication push) stay
//! with their domains; only the queue subsystem lives here.
