//! Storage façade: the single seam subsystems use for storage.
//!
//! [`Store`] composes the storage handles a subsystem needs (an
//! [`ObjectStore`], the CRUD floor plus the upload-session lifecycle)
//! together with the [`TransactionExecutor`] that commits coordinated writes.
//! [`Store::new`] is the engine's construction seam: it builds the lock
//! primitive and selects the executor from operator-level inputs, so
//! subsystems (`metadata_store`, `job_store`) hold a single `Arc<Store>` and
//! never instantiate locks or executors directly. [`Store::maintenance`]
//! returns the engine's recovery loop wired over the same primitives (the
//! caller spawns it) and a one-shot janitor sweep for external maintenance.
//!
//! The façade stays domain-agnostic: it speaks only `String` keys and `Bytes`
//! bodies. Registry domain types (`Digest`, `LinkKind`, OCI hashing, serde)
//! stay in the registry.
//!
//! # Error surface
//!
//! Raw object I/O (reads, non-transactional writes, the upload lifecycle)
//! goes straight through [`Store::object_store`] and returns [`StorageError`],
//! so callers keep matching [`StorageError::NotFound`] directly. The
//! coordinated helpers ([`Store::update`] and [`Store::update_with_payload`])
//! return the engine [`Error`] (carrying `Conflict`/`Precondition`).
