//! Storage backends for the lock primitive.
//!
//! The [`LockStorage`] trait defines the minimal set of operations the concrete
//! [`Lock`](crate::lock::Lock) needs from its storage layer. Three implementations
//! are provided:
//!
//! - [`MemoryLockStorage`](memory::MemoryLockStorage): in-process mutex map
//!   (no TTL; suitable for single-process deployments and tests).
//! - [`S3LockStorage`](s3::S3LockStorage): uses `put_if_absent`,
//!   `put_if_match`, and conditional delete on S3-compatible stores that
//!   advertise CAS support.
//! - [`RedisLockStorage`](redis::RedisLockStorage) (feature `redis`): Redis
//!   `SET NX EX` plus Lua scripts for atomic refresh and release; suitable for
//!   FS deployments under heavy concurrent load.
