/// prefix with nothing under it counts as success. `get` and `head` on a

/// # Uploads
///
/// A single append-only upload primitive that both FS (append-mode file) and
/// S3 (multipart protocol) implement, hiding the S3 multipart wire details
/// (parts, upload IDs, staged remainders) from consumers. Every upload is
/// addressed solely by its `key`; there is no caller-held session value. The
/// caller drives an upload by calling [`ObjectStore::create_upload`] once,
/// [`ObjectStore::write_upload`] per chunk, and finally
/// [`ObjectStore::complete_upload`] or [`ObjectStore::abort_upload`]. After
/// `complete_upload`, the assembled object is visible via the read methods at
/// `key`.
///
/// The S3 backend recovers all multipart state (the in-flight upload id, the
/// committed parts, and the staged sub-part remainder) from S3 itself on every
/// call, so nothing has to be persisted by the caller between calls. The staged
/// remainder lives at a `staged/<offset>` child of the upload key's
/// container: the backend derives that location from `key` alone (it replaces
/// `key`'s
/// final path segment with `staged/<offset>`, where `offset` is the number of
/// bytes already committed to parts). This mirrors the historical
/// `.../_uploads/<uuid>/staged/<offset>` layout so it stays backward
/// compatible.
