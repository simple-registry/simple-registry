//! One struct per distribution-API operation, spoken by both ends: a registry
//! reads what it was asked for, and the client that pulls or replicates to an
//! upstream fills in the same shape.
//!
//! An open upload session is addressed by the continuation URL the server
//! assigns, which the spec keeps opaque, so only the receiving side of those
//! operations names a session by [`UploadSessionId`].
